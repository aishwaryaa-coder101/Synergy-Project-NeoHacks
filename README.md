**PROBLEM**

The physical, mental and social health of countless people around the world have deterioted and continues to deteriote every second. There can be various reasons for a person's health to worsen but it can be easily identified that one of these causes is the COVID-19 pandemic. We were indoors for a long period of time (lockdowns). At one stage, some people stopped interacting with their loved ones and isolated themselves. 
Sooner or later, people become anxious, depressed and lonely. 

This has a huge **NEGATIVE IMPACT** not only in one's **mental/emotional well-being** but their physical health as well. 

**SOLUTION**

Therefore to combat this horrible disease, I present to you **SYNERGY**. Synergy is a **user-friendly** and calming app which improves one's physical, mental and social well-being through simple daily activities. It provides Indoor activities (diary-writing, yoga, listening to music), Outdoor activities (jogging, cycling, reading), and food donation/tree plantation programs. In addition to this, **SYNERGY** has its own community where people can express their thoughts and feelings freely (in discord).


**SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS**

Synergy also achieves the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals:

- Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being
