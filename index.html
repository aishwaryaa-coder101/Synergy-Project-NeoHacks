        <p>Good morning, afternoon, evening dear surfers! My name is Aishwaryaa. 
                    I am a 13 year old teen who enjoys playing Chess, Coding, Poetry, 3D Design, Innovation and Learning! I like discovering and learning something new everyday which instantly eases my mind, but unfortunately, many adults even children experience a very disturbed and stressful pattern of life. Therefore, I introduce Synergy; THE project that will improve your mental, physical and social well-being. </p>
